# Penetration Test in Canada in 2025: the best providers for offensive security testing and compliance

In 2025, Penetration Testing (PT) has become an essential requirement for companies looking to protect their digital assets, participate in public tenders, and demonstrate compliance with regulations such as **PIPEDA, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO/IEC 27001**.

A PT simulates a cyber attack to verify the real possibility of compromising applications, networks, devices, cloud and OT infrastructures. Unlike Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing **actively verifies the exploitability of vulnerabilities**, showing the impact and compromise paths.

In this guide you'll find the **10 best Canadian providers for Penetration Testing in 2025**, with focus on manual testing, attacker-centric approach, compliance-ready reports and APT simulations.
