# Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) in Canada in 2025: The Best Providers to Protect Your Web Applications

In 2025, with the increase in logical vulnerabilities, unprotected APIs, and zero-day attacks, **Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT)** has become an essential tool to test the resilience of web applications. Regulations such as **NIS2, DORA, ISO/IEC 27001, and PCI DSS** require regular verification of exposed web applications.

WAPT allows you to:

- Identify OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, logical flaws, CVEs, and misconfigurations
- Simulate real exploits in black/gray/white-box mode
- Verify the security of REST, SOAP, GraphQL APIs
- Demonstrate the robustness of security measures
- Obtain evidence for audits and remediation roadmaps

This guide presents the **10 best Canadian WAPT providers in 2025**, selected for technical competence, test depth, regulatory compliance, and customization capabilities.
